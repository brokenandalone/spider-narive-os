# Spider OS 26.10 Migration Status

Updated: 2026-10-04

## Repository policy

The upgrade is being carried in both:

- `brokenandalone/spider-narive-os`
- `brokenandalone/Spider-OS1`

`spider-narive-os` is the authoritative bootable implementation because it is the repository that produced the install that actually boots. `Spider-OS1` mirrors the roadmap and migration work without replacing the mature installer/qualification logic.

## Real-machine preflight result

Preflight run: 2026-10-04 21:28 local

Result: PASS for the checks reviewed so far.

Observed on the currently booting Spider OS:

- UEFI boot
- 465.8 GB internal disk
- 512 MB FAT32 EFI System Partition mounted at /boot/efi
- 449 MB ext4 /boot
- LUKS2 encrypted /dev/sda5 with existing password unlock
- LVM inside LUKS
- 449 GB ext4 root volume
- approximately 385 GiB free on /
- no dpkg audit errors
- no failed systemd units
- release upgrader configured with Prompt=lts
- current Spider OS identity reports Ubuntu 24.04 / Noble base

Before invoking do-release-upgrade, still review:

- lsb_release output
- non-Ubuntu apt sources
- package holds
- Spider Core service state
- Webbie user-service state
- GRUB probe/version
- recent high-severity boot errors
- external backup of user/project data

Do not use do-release-upgrade -d.

## Real-machine preflight follow-up

Observed after USB and service/repository checks:

- 64 GB Kingston DataTraveler detected as /dev/sdb, 57.6 GiB usable, with /dev/sdb1 FAT32 label KINGSTON
- package holds: none
- Spider Core: active and enabled
- Webbie user service: active and enabled
- Webbie currently captures microphone audio through parec
- GRUB 2.12-1ubuntu7.3
- grub-probe reports ext2 for the ext4 root filesystem, which is normal for GRUB's ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystem module naming
- third-party apt sources are present for Tailscale and Cloudflare/cloudflared
- official Ubuntu Noble sources are also present
- the third-party apt sources must be disabled before the release upgrade and restored/reconfigured only after the target release is stable
- external backup to the 64 GB USB is still required before invoking do-release-upgrade

## External backup completed

Status: PASS

- 64 GB Kingston DataTraveler reformatted as ext4 with label `SPIDER_BACKUP`
- backup mounted at `/media/spider/SPIDER_BACKUP`
- pre-upgrade backup includes the user's home directory, Spider OS payload, Spider Media Center, original Spider Media Player, critical system configuration, and preflight diagnostics
- checksum verification completed successfully with no reported failures
- approximately 48 GiB remained free on the backup drive after the backup
- this external backup is the recovery anchor before the in-place release upgrade

Next step: temporarily disable third-party apt repositories, fully update Ubuntu 24.04/Noble, reboot once, then re-run health checks before invoking the 24.04 -> 26.04.1 release upgrade.

## Current phase

### Phase 0: Preserve working system
Status: COMPLETE IN GIT

- working baseline branch exists
- main remains untouched by 26.10 base changes
- migration work is isolated from the current booting installation
- current LUKS password unlock behavior remains unchanged

### Phase 1: Ubuntu Studio 26.10 migration foundation
Status: IN PROGRESS

Implemented on `migration/ubuntu-studio-26.10`:

- base configuration points to Ubuntu Studio 26.10 beta
- codename is Stonking Stingray / `stonking`
- beta image naming is centralized in `distro/config/base.env`
- ISO builder now reads base settings from `base.env`
- installed and live Spider OS identity follows the configured base
- GitHub Actions resolves the Spider ISO name from configuration
- build publishing notes follow the configured base
- master plan and dual-repository sync rules are present on the migration branch

Next gate:

- validate the exact 26.10 ISO layer layout
- adapt installer/source handling if 26.10 changed the Casper layout
- build the migration ISO
- boot live image
- install to disposable virtual disk
- remove ISO
- boot installed virtual disk
- verify writable root
- verify Spider Core
- verify Webbie
- verify The Web
- verify backgrounds/workspaces
- reboot installed virtual disk again

Do not merge into `main` until the installed-boot gate passes.

## Shared feature queue after the 26.10 boot gate

1. Rebuild The Web workspace framework and workspace backgrounds.
2. School workspace with SNHU integration and the former Study background.
3. Author workspace with manuscript/canon/research/publishing tools.
4. Spider Studio upgrade on the 26.10 creative stack.
5. Spider Media Center reintegration and qualification.
6. Webbie Jarvis upgrade: continuous voice, modes, permissions, browser/site control, local/online routing, system/app control.
7. Webbie autonomous research plus at least one self-selected learning topic every day.
8. 256 GB Webbie Intelligence Vault.
9. 64 GB Portable AI DJ.
10. Kali Purple / Kali Bay.
11. System + Recovery.
12. Full final qualification.

## Boot safety rule

A feature is not worth losing the currently booting Spider OS.

Any change that touches the base OS, bootloader, initramfs, encryption, Plasma startup, installer, Spider Core startup, Webbie startup, or The Web startup must have a tested rollback path before it is promoted.
